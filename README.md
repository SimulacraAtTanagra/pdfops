## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This project exists to collect and standardize the code that I use to interact with DPF files, including writing them, reading them, locking and unlocking fields, detecting signatures, etc. 
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
In order to complete processes involving dynamic information management on a variety of documents, I needed an easy way to procedurally generate documents such as letters, employment verification documents and Personnel Action Forms. This was also handy in getting around some of the inherent limitations in Adobe, like easily locking and unlocking fields, and adjusting the reading order of fields, etc. 



The expected frequency for running this code is As Needed.
